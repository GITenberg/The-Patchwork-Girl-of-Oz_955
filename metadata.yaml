description: "The Patchwork Girl of Oz by L. Frank Baum, is a children's novel, the\
  \ 7th set in the Land of Oz. Characters include the Woozy, Ojo \"the Unlucky\",\
  \ Unc Nunkie, Dr. Pipt, Scraps (the patchwork girl), and others. The book was first\
  \ published on July 1, 1913, with illustrations by John R. Neill. In 1914, Baum\
  \ adapted the book to film through his \"Oz Film Manufacturing Company.\"\nIn the\
  \ previous Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz, magic was used to isolate Oz from all\
  \ outside worlds. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart\
  \ the series with this book due to financial hardships. In the prologue, he explains\
  \ how he managed to get another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from\
  \ all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with\
  \ wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens,\
  \ is able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects\
  \ a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply,\
  \ tell the story contained in this book to Baum.\nThe book was dedicated to Sumner\
  \ Hamilton Britton, the young son of one of its publishers, Sumner Charles Britton\
  \ of Reilly & Britton.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
